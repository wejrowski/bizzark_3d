Bizzark 3d World
================

This was code built for the [first version of bizzark.com](http://bizzark1.bizzark.com). I isolated the 3d background code here for you to browse. It uses [Mathieu Badimon's FIVe3D](http://five3d.mathieu-badimon.com/) for the 3D API. I created custom classes to create the 3d world with randomized triangles and all the randomized motion. Making use of all that Trigonometry I learned in school!


PS. You won't be able to run it unless you download and import [Mathieu Badimon's FIVe3D](http://five3d.mathieu-badimon.com/) in your flash settings.
